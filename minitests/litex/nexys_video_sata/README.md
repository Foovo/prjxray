LiteSATA minitest
=================

This minitest is intended to provide a counter-prove on the possible remaining features to document for
the Gigabit Transcievers (GTP tiles).

It uses the following litex modules:

| Repo URL                                                  | SHA     |

The minitest synthesis step can be performed with Yosys or Vivado.

The final FASM file with the `unknown bits` can be obtained by running the following:

```bash
make all
```

All the pre-requisites (LiteX, Yosys, etc.) are automatically installed/built. It is required though to have Vivado installed in the system.
